Dear Fred Smith,

It has come to our attention that vehicle registration YK52 ABC was parked in our car park for 2.02 hours. 
There is a Â£200 fine for all customers that stay longer than 2 hours in our car park. You car arrived at 09:35:23 
and left at 11:36:24 and this is a total time of 2.02 hours. This has resulted in a fine that you must pay in the next 
10 working days. 

Kind Regards,
The Fine Team
