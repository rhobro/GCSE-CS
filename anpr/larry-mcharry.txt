Dear Larry McHarry,

It has come to our attention that vehicle registration YT55 AFS was parked in our car park for 4.55 hours. 
There is a Â£200 fine for all customers that stay longer than 2 hours in our car park. You car arrived at 12:02:16 
and left at 16:35:24 and this is a total time of 4.55 hours. This has resulted in a fine that you must pay in the next 
10 working days. 

Kind Regards,
The Fine Team
