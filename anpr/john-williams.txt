Dear John Williams,

It has come to our attention that vehicle registration PR15 GHR was parked in our car park for 5.63 hours. 
There is a Â£200 fine for all customers that stay longer than 2 hours in our car park. You car arrived at 09:37:00 
and left at 15:15:01 and this is a total time of 5.63 hours. This has resulted in a fine that you must pay in the next 
10 working days. 

Kind Regards,
The Fine Team
