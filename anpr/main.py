Dear {name},

It has come to our attention that vehicle registration <reg goes here> was parked in our car park for {time} hours. 
There is a Â£200 fine for all customers that stay longer than 2 hours in our car park. You car arrived at {start} 
and left at {end} and this is a total time of {time} hours. This has resulted in a fine that you must pay in the next 
10 working days. 

Kind Regards,
